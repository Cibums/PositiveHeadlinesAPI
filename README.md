**Positive Headlines Chrome Extension Backend**

This is the backend for the chrome extension here:
https://github.com/Cibums/PositiveHeadlinesChromeExtension

It talks to a firebase database that contains data of new (arguably better) headlines for news articles. If a new article is opened by anyone who uses the chrome extension, it will create a new headline and add it to the database. This means that anyone opening this article in the future will see the same headline.
